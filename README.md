# Modern

![gtk3](Modern_icon.png)

A GTK+3/GTK+4 theme, based on Adwaita technology and style from my site.

Changes, what included:

* Recolor accent to my favourite color;
* Tweaks for titlebar/headerbar;
* Tweaks for buttons;
* Toolbar/notebook tweaks.

## Known bugs

1. Some accents not recolored (because some backgrounds/borders colored with *rgba(xx, xx, xx, xx)*, this different search);
2. Little bugs in GTK+4 theme with headerbar/titlebar;
3. GTK+4 theme might be bugged, some colors don't changed, etc;
4. Not working decoration-maximized, decoration-inactive zones in aurorae-theme;
5. What i don't see.
