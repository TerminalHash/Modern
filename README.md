# Modern

A GTK+3/GTK+4 theme, based on Adwaita technology and style from my site. Changes, what included:

* Recolor accent to my favourite color;
* Tweaks for titlebar/headerbar;
* Tweaks for buttons;
* Toolbar/notebook tweaks.

Known bugs:

1. Some accents not recolored (because some backgrounds/borders colored with *rgb(xx, xx, xx, xx)*, this different search).
2. What i don't see.
